# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



**In this project I build a React project with Vite, crafting a stunning user interface with Tailwind CSS, usage of state and props in React, creating a Firebase project and connecting it to our React app, building a dynamic job listing system, storing job data in Firebase Firestore , Real-time updates using Firebase Firestore. And much more!**

**Built with**
  ```
  React JS
  Tailwind CSS
  Firebase
  ```
